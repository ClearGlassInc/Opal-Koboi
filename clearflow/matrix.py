"""Strategic Priority Matrix construction.

A thin builder over :class:`~clearflow.models.WorkItem` that turns the daily
matrix - the P0/P1/P2 rows the operator writes each morning - into wired work
items. :func:`build_matrix` accepts plain dict rows so the matrix can come from
a CSV, a JSON config, or the literal table in the morning brief.

:func:`todays_matrix` seeds ClearGlassInc's matrix for the current day so the
demo and tests reproduce the exact program the bot was commissioned to run.

# ClearFlow — AI Automation Core Workflow Engine

ClearFlow is ClearGlassInc's daily operating model encoded as a workflow engine.
It exists to enforce **one discipline**:

> Advance exactly **ONE keystone outcome** today (the day's P0), and let it
> *unlock* every other domain behind it.

The bot ingests a **Strategic Priority Matrix**, the morning **pledge** (three
commitments), and the **Critical Intelligence Brief**, then drives the keystone
to `DONE` — the single event that opens the rest of the day.

This package is a **scaffold** in the same spirit as the sibling `clearpulse`:
the core logic is real and unit-tested, while the distributed substrate (a
scheduler daemon, a persistence store, a notifier fan-out, a dashboard) is
represented by clean in-process seams ready to be wired to those services.

## The single-outcome contract

The gate is the whole point. Every non-keystone item starts `LOCKED` and depends
on the keystone. The engine refuses to start another domain while the keystone
is open; completing the keystone (with evidence against its success metric)
reconciles the gate and flips every now-satisfied item `LOCKED → PENDING`.

```
P0  AI Automation   Code core workflow module     ← keystone (the one thing)
P1  Cybersecurity   Review key vulnerabilities     LOCKED ──┐ unlock when
P2  Personal Brand  LinkedIn post on AI trend       LOCKED ──┘ keystone lands
```

> Fittingly, today's keystone *is this module* — "Code core workflow module,
> functional and tested." Running the test suite green is the success metric.

## Layout

| Module | Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `models.py` | Data | `WorkItem`, `Pledge`, `IntelSignal`, `TimeBlock`, `Priority`/`Status`, Trace IDs. |
| `matrix.py` | Data | Build/seed the Strategic Priority Matrix from rows. |
| `engine/gating.py` | Logic | `DomainGatekeeper` — wires the keystone gate, reconciles unlocks. |
| `engine/scheduler.py` | Logic | `BlockScheduler` — resolves *what should I do right now?* |
| `engine/pledge.py` | Logic | `PledgeLedger` — three daily commitments + next-day review. |
| `intel/brief.py` | Intel | `IntelRouter` — routes brief headlines to the domain they inform. |
| `workflow.py` | Orchestration | `AutomationWorkflow` — binds the stages, enforces the contract. |
| `bot.py` | Front end | `DailyOutcomeBot` — morning briefing, live status, close-out. |

## Running

```bash
# Core engine + tests need only the standard library.
python3 -m unittest clearflow.tests.test_clearflow -v

# The seeded single-outcome day, start to finish (no external services).
python3 -m clearflow.bot

# A narrated demo that proves the gate (other domains refuse to start early).
python3 -m clearflow.demo
```

## Driving it from code

```python
from clearflow.bot import DailyOutcomeBot

bot = DailyOutcomeBot.from_today()
print(bot.morning_briefing())

# Land the keystone with evidence; everything gated behind it unlocks.
unlocked = bot.land_keystone("module functional, tested")
print(bot.status_line())
```

Or bring your own matrix:

```python
from clearflow.matrix import build_matrix
from clearflow.workflow import AutomationWorkflow

wf = AutomationWorkflow(build_matrix([
    {"priority": "P0", "domain": "AI Automation",
     "action": "Code core workflow module", "time_block": "8-10 AM",
     "success_metric": "Module functional, tested"},
    {"priority": "P1", "domain": "Cybersecurity",
     "action": "Review key vulnerabilities", "time_block": "10:30-11:30 AM",
     "success_metric": "Report with 3 fixes"},
]))
wf.start(wf.keystone)
wf.complete(wf.keystone, "tested and shipped")   # unlocks the P1
```

## Known extensions (intentionally out of scope for the scaffold)

- Persisting the matrix and pledge ledger across days (so "Yesterday's Pledge
  Review" reads from real history instead of "no prior data").
- A notifier seam (Slack/email/calendar) firing when the keystone lands and a
  domain unlocks — the Zapier/Gmail/Calendar MCP servers in this workspace are
  the natural wiring points.
- A FastAPI gateway (`clearflow.backend`) mirroring `clearpulse.backend` so the
  bot can be driven over HTTP from a dashboard.
- Richer intel routing (embeddings instead of keyword hits) and auto-attaching
  signals to the matrix rows they inform.
